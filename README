           With the help of the gnome-shell community
           
CHANGE LOGS:
    V12:
    Correct small bug on auto tile where monitor height was considered without gnome-panel on primaryMonitor

    V11:
    AutoTile function : 2 new auto tile features + Replace Animation and auto close text by icons
    
    V10: 
    Now gTile follows your focus window !! Thanks to Claus Beerta he implements it in a branch.
    I change the implementation so that it works with  multi-screen and I also added animations.
    
    V9:
    Not validated
    
    However he added the keybinding in settings (into the file extension.js) but it s still buggy I think
    So I let it for those who wants to try it.

    V8:
    Correct bug where Desktop can be tile
    3x2 button added by default
    
    V7:
    Add Auto-close once resize
    Add Smooth animation when toggle extension
    New icon
    
    (/!\ auto-close may cause some bugs so let me know if you had any thanks).

To configure gTile open the file extension.js
go down to SETTINGS comments
and edit this part of code:

/*****************************************************************
                            SETTINGS
*****************************************************************/
/*INIT SETTINGS HERE TO ADD OR REMOVE SETTINGS BUTTON*/
/*new GridSettingsButton(LABEL, NBCOL, NBROW) */
function initSettings()
{
    //Here is where you add new grid size button
    gridSettings[SETTINGS_GRID_SIZE] = [
        new GridSettingsButton('2x2',2,2),
        new GridSettingsButton('4x4',4,4),
        new GridSettingsButton('6x6',6,6)
    ];
    
    //example for new GridSettingsButton:
    myCustomButton = new GridSettingsButton('Custom',8,8); //Going to be a 8x8 GridSettings
    gridSettings[SETTINGS_GRID_SIZE].push(myCustomButton);
    
    
    /*NEW SETTINGS*/    
     //You can change those settings to set whatever you want by default
     //Afterward you can change those parameters using the gTile interface
     gridSettings[SETTINGS_AUTO_CLOSE] = true;
     gridSettings[SETTINGS_ANIMATION] = true;
}
